<h1>Rapid Development of Components</h1>
<p>When developing Yanel components, often there is no need to compile everything. Two cases where this applies are <strong>webapp classes</strong> and <strong>resource classes</strong>.</p>
<h2>Efficiently building webapp classes</h2>
<p>Webapp classes are all classes that are under <code>{yanel.home}/src/webapp/src/java/org/wyona/yanel/servlet</code>. In order to build and test these classes efficiently, one can run:</p>
<pre>{yanel.home}/build.sh compile-webapp copy-basic-webapp-libs copy-webapp-files-to-tomcat-cluster-node1</pre>
<p>instead of running the whole build process. This will build only the webapp and redeploy it, and should reduce the waiting time from a couple of minutes to a couple of seconds.</p>
<h2>Efficiently building resource classes</h2>
<p>Resource classes can be found in separate directories at several locations, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{yanel.home}/src/resources</code></li>
<li><code>{yanel.home}/src/contributions/resources</code></li>
<li><code>{yanel.home}src/realms/welcome-admin/yanel/resources</code></li>
<li><code>{yanel.home}src/realms/from-scratch-realm-template/res-types</code></li>
<li><code>{my.realm}res-types</code></li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes all have their own <code>build.xml</code> files, so to compile them efficiently, one can run the build as</p>
<pre>{yanel.home}/build.sh -f {path.to.resource.dir}/build.xml</pre>
<p>instead of running the whole build process. Again, this will reduce the building time significantly, as only the changed resource will be built.</p>
<h2>Efficiently building single realms</h2>
<p>In the same way as building resource classes, it is also possible to build single realms after editing classes belonging to that realm:</p>
<pre>{yanel.home}/build.sh -f {my.realm}/build.xml</pre>
<p>&#160;</p>
