The important thing is that Yanel allows one to choose any kind of persistence manager either by accessing it directly from within a resource or by using one or more content repository APIs (for example JCR or Yarep).<p>The implementation of the content navigation is also <a href="../realm/realm-configuration.html#repo-navigation">configurable</a> per realm and therefore does not impose any restrictions.</p><h2>Sessions<br/></h2>The scalability of the number of concurrent sessions is of course related to <a href="performance.html">performance</a> in general, but since Yanel is clusterable it also depends on the right choice of application server. There are many well-known Java based application servers, for example Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, WebSphere or WebLogic. Since Yanel itself nicely separates the application from the data handling/storage, one can easily deploy Yanel on multiple &quot;working&quot; machines (second layer) behind a load-balancer (first layer), whereas the data storage could be on separate shared machines (third layer), which are, for example, mounted by the &quot;working&quot; machines and replicated by the persistance manager itself, whereas the repository journal would be shared by the working machines.</body>
