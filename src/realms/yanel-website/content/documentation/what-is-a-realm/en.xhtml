<h1>What is a realm?</h1>
<p>
A realm is a part of Yanel which has its own configuration and repository. 
This allows you to run several subsites (which are independent of one another)
in a single Yanel instance.  For example, each department in your company can
have its own realm. This allows one department to use its database as a content
repository and another to use the filesystem to provide the content to Yanel.
</p>

<p>
Realms can also be nested, which allows you to have a subsite within a subsite.
Continuing with the department example, one department could have its public
file-based website within its realm and access its database for internal use in
a subrealm.
