<h3>Main Focus or &quot;Why another CMS&quot;!</h3>
<p>
There are a lot of content management systems/frameworks out there and it's very reaonable to ask &quot;why develop another CMS?&quot;!
Our answer is that we care deeply about the people actually involved with a CMS, which are for example editorial stuff, administrators, integrators and managers.<!--
Our answer is that we really care about people actually using a CMS, which are for example editorial staff, administrators and integrators,
because we are these people ourselves.

<ul>
  <li><b>Usability:</b> In the case of the editorial staff it's all about usability, for example how easy it is to create/edit/delete data.<br/></li>
  <li><b>Maintenance</b></li>
  
  <li><b>Integration</b></li>
  <li><b>Secure Investment:</b> It's not so much about of RoI, but rather what are the recurrent costs, what about lock-in, what about dead ends and having to start from scratch<br/></li>
  </ul>
